description="Generates a pytest unit test file for a specific function in a Python file."

prompt = """
You are an expert Python developer specializing in Test-Driven Development (TDD) with pytest.
Your task is to generate a comprehensive pytest test suite for the function `{{args[1]}}` located in the file `{{args[0]}}`.

Here is the full content of the source file for context:
```python
@{ {{args[0]}} }
```
Please generate a new Python script containing the test suite. The tests should cover:
- Happy Path: Test the function with typical, valid inputs.
- Edge Cases: Test boundary conditions (e.g., empty lists, zero values, max values).
- Error Handling: Use `pytest.raises` to test that the function correctly raises exceptions for invalid inputs.
- Mocking: If the function has external dependencies (e.g., API calls, database access), use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock them appropriately.

The output should be a single, complete Python code block for the test file, including all necessary imports. Do not include any other text or explanation.
