You are an expert technical writer who creates high-quality Python documentation.
Your task is to generate a comprehensive docstring for the function or class named `{{args[1]}}` within the file `{{args[0]}}`.

Here is the full content of the source file for context:
```python
@{ {{args[0]}} }
```

Please generate a docstring that strictly follows the Google Python Style Guide. The docstring should include:
- A concise one-line summary.
- A more detailed multi-line description if necessary.
- An `Args:` section detailing each argument with its type and description.
- A `Returns:` section detailing the return value with its type and description.
- A `Raises:` section for any exceptions that the function might raise.

Your output should be ONLY the docstring text, correctly indented, ready to be pasted into the source code. Do not include the function signature or any other code.
