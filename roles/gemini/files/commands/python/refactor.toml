description="Analyzes a Python file and suggests intelligent refactoring improvements."

prompt = """
You are a senior Python architect with deep expertise in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
Your task is to analyze the following Python code from the file `{{args[0]}}` and provide actionable refactoring suggestions.

**Source Code:**
```python
@{ {{args[0]}} }
```

Please provide your analysis in two parts:
1.  **High-Level Suggestions:** In a markdown list, describe the key areas for improvement. This could include suggestions for improving algorithmic efficiency, simplifying complex logic, improving variable naming, or breaking down large functions into smaller, single-responsibility ones.
2.  **Refactored Code:** Provide the complete, refactored version of the code in a single Python code block. The new code should implement your suggestions.

Focus on improvements that enhance readability, performance, and adherence to PEP 8 standards.
